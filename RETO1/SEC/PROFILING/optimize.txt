Summary of Optimizations
Core Computation:
Improve memory access patterns.
Use vectorization.
Parallelism:
Use OpenMP, processes, or GPU acceleration.
Boundary Conditions:
Avoid redundant computations.
Precision:
Use float instead of double if possible.
Profiling:
Use tools like perf or Intel VTune for deeper insights.
Solver:
Consider more efficient iterative solvers like Gauss-Seidel or Multigrid.
By implementing these optimizations, you can significantly improve the performance of the Jacobi 1D algorithm.
